A memory leak tracking library for Android and Java.

If you are developing an API where your clients must bind and unbind with their
observers, then wouldnâ€™t it be better if you could reduce the chance of misuse?

LeakTracker helps detect when your observers aren't unbound properly.

## Getting started

Somewhere in your code store a reference to the tracker.
[Dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) such
as [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/) is recommended to inject this
instance where it is needed.

```kotlin
val tracker = LeakTracker { exception ->
    // Log the exception as you wish
    Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Subscription leaked", exception)
}
```

Then in your APIs addObserver/bind/subscribe method use the `tracker.subscribe`
function to return an Unsubscriber.

```kotlin
@CheckResult
fun addObserver(observer: Observer): Unsubscriber {
    // save your observer here

    return tracker.subscribe {
        // remove your observer here
    }
}
```

LeakTracker will automatically call your exception handler when an
`Unsubscriber` is garbage collected without being called.
